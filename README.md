### Hello World! 👋

My name is Giacomo Ellero and I'm an Italian student 🇮🇹

### What I know 👨‍💻

- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), it's just amazing
- [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for light web apps
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) not too much, just for [Unity](https://unity.com/). Intrested in the future of dotnet, expecially for desktop and gaming
- Working my way through C++, some time is cool to work at such a low level

### What I'm intrested in 📖

- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) & [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter), intrested in Flutter Web and Flutter Desktop
- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust): really powerful but quite difficult, I had no need for it yet 
- [V](https://github.com/vlang/v): cool concept, really intrested in it's evolution
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot): an opensource replacement for Unity, need time to learn

I use [Arch](https://archlinux.org) btw: checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/billy4479/dotfiles) 🐧
